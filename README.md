# LINK-O
An [OWL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language) ontology for all the information within the [LINK System](http://link.fsdf.org.au) which itself is within the Foundational Spatial Data Framework (FSDF) initative.

This ontology contains classes for all of the major information objects that the LINK system publishes. The LINK system uses a web Content Management System to manage the data which has its own database. In order for that information to be interoperable with information in other applications, the LINK information is mapped to a series of 'upper' (generic) ontologies (data models) which information in other applications can then also be mapped to. So an 'Agency' in the LINK is mapped to an [ORG](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/) ontology 'Organisation' so other information understanding an Organisation will understand something about a LINK Agency.
